# 1. Merge the theoretical elements (Capucine annexes + me) into
# /vignettes/Theory_QTL_variance_MPP.Rmd

# 2. Integrate the simulation function into mppSim package
#       - go through the whole function and utils for mc
#       - compare single and multiple cross
#       - explore possibility to make single cross a specific case of MC
#         (play on denominator constant)
#       - make the function with no annotation as default (propf = 0)
#       - addition of an argument for user specified k connected to QTL detection [Arthur]

# (v)

# 3. Finalize the QTL_eff_sim_MPP.Rmd file with simulation and check steps
#       - make sure that genotype simulation and phenotype simulation work
#       - single and multiple cross situation
#       - check operation (plot, GP, QTL) can also be finalized by [Arthur]
