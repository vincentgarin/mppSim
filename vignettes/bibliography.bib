	abstract = {The study of QTL × environment interaction (QEI) is important for understanding genotype × environment interaction (GEI) in many quantitative traits. For modeling GEI and QEI, factorial regression (FR) models form a powerful class of models. In FR models, covariables (contrasts) defined on the levels of the genotypic and/or environmental factor(s) are used to describe main effects and interactions. In FR models for QTL expression, considerable numbers of genotypic covariables can occur as for each putative QTL an additional covariable needs to be introduced. For large numbers of genotypic and/or environmental covariables, least square estimation breaks down and partial least squares (PLS) estimation procedures become an attractive alternative. In this paper we develop methodology for analyzing QEI by FR for estimating effects and locations of QTLs and QEI and interpreting QEI in terms of environmental variables. A randomization test for the main effects of QTLs and QEI is presented. A population of F2 derived F3 families was evaluated in eight environments differing in drought stress and soil nitrogen content and the traits yield and anthesis silking interval (ASI) were measured. For grain yield, chromosomes 1 and 10 showed significant QEI, whereas in chromosomes 3 and 8 only main effect QTLs were observed. For ASI, QTL main effects were observed on chromosomes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 10, whereas QEI was observed only on chromosome 8. The assessment of the QEI at chromosome 1 for grain yield showed that the QTL main effect explained 35.8\% of the QTL + QEI variability, while QEI explained 64.2\%. Minimum temperature during flowering time explained 77.6\% of the QEI. The QEI analysis at chromosome 10 showed that the QTL main effect explained 59.8\% of the QTL + QEI variability, while QEI explained 40.2\%. Maximum temperature during flowering time explained 23.8\% of the QEI. Results of this study show the possibilities of using FR for mapping QTL and for dissecting QEI in terms of environmental variables. PLS regression is efficient in accounting for background noise produced by other QTLs.},

	abstract = {Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is grown widely in the arid and semi-arid tropical regions in Indian subcontinent and African continent under the most adverse agro-climatic conditions where other crops like sorghum and maize fail to produce economic yields. Its grains are valued as human food while its dry stover makes important livestock ration in crop–livestock farming system. Enormous progress has been made in the genetic improvement of pearl millet in India during last several decades. This paper presents an overview of strategies followed in genetic improvement of pearl millet, assesses the impact of this research on crop productivity and presents its future prospects in climate-change scenario for providing food and nutritional security. The genetic improvement programme evolved strongly starting from selection in local and traditional material and reaching development of high-yielding hybrids with in-built resistance to diseases and tolerance to climatic stresses like drought and heat. The major approach in hybrid breeding has been to strategically utilize germplasm from Africa and Indian subcontinent with the result that a large number of genetically diverse hybrids have been developed with different combinations of phenotypic traits that are important for adaptation to different ecological regions. The genetic diversification of hybrids has proved very critical to contain downy mildew epidemics which had threatened hybrid technology per se in mid-1970s. A great deal of work has been done on understanding the epidemiology of different diseases and crop response to moisture stress that helped in developing disease-resistant and stress-tolerant cultivars. More than 100 cultivars with a combination of diverse phenotypic traits have been released in the last 25 years, providing a wide range of choice to farmers in different production ecologies of the crop. These cultivars have been widely adopted by Indian farmers with the result that the crop productivity has gone up from 305 kg ha−1 during 1951–1955 to 998 kg ha−1 during 2008–2012, registering a 227 \% improvement which assumes greater significance given that more than 90 \% of pearl millet is grown as rainfed and often on marginal lands. In future, pearl millet is likely to play a greater role in providing food and nutritional security. Pearl millet would also be an excellent genomic resource for isolation of candidate genes responsible for tolerance to climatic and edaphic stresses for accelerating further genetic improvement of this crop as well as for their possible deployment in the genetic improvement of other crops.},

	abstract = {The identification of haplotypes influencing traits of agronomic interest, with well-defined effects across environments, is of key importance to develop varieties adapted to their context of use. It requires advanced crossing schemes, multi-environment characterization and relevant statistical tools. Here we present a sorghum multi-reference back-cross nested association mapping (BCNAM) population composed of 3901 lines produced by crossing 24 diverse parents to three elite parents from West and Central Africa (WCA-BCNAM). The population was characterized in environments contrasting for photoperiod, rainfall, temperature, and soil fertility. To analyse this multi-parental and multi-environment design, we developed a new methodology for QTL detection and parental effect estimation. In addition, envirotyping data were mobilized to determine the influence of specific environmental covariables on the genetic effects, which allowed spatial projections of the QTL effects. We mobilized this strategy to analyse the genetic architecture of flowering time and plant height, which represent key adaptation mechanisms in environments like West Africa. Our results allowed a better characterisation of well-known genomic regions influencing flowering time concerning their response to photoperiod with Ma6 and Ma1 being photoperiod sensitive and candidate gene Elf3 being insensitive. We also accessed a better understanding of plant height genetic determinism with the combined effects of phenology dependent (Ma6) and independent (qHT7.1 and Dw3) genomic regions. Therefore, we argue that the WCA-BCNAM constitutes a key genetic resource to feed breeding programs in relevant elite parental lines and develop climate-smart varieties.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
